node-png-joyent
===============

This is a fork of [node-png](https://github.com/pkrumins/node-png) used to
build Joyent's [cloud analytics](http://dtrace.org/blogs/dap/2011/03/01/welcome-to-cloud-analytics/)
facility, now a part of SmartDataCenter.
This repository exists only to allow for a (formerly) private branch of
node-png and dates from the Paleozoic era of node.js; it is likely unsuitable
for any modern purpose.
